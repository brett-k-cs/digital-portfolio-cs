	AI Sentience is beneficial but could have dire consequences. I think we are far from a completely Sentient AI; however, we are getting close to AIs that know pretty much everything about one topic. An example of this is DALL-E 2. It is the most advanced text-to-image converter available currently. It specializes in making words into pictures (Roose, 2022). There are also Large Language Models such as BLOOM with over 176 billion parameters meaning they are available in multiple languages and have numerous topics. Nevertheless, they take an entire server room to run (Bloom). Bloom is an AI, but it is not sentient. It cannot think for itself. It can take the arguments it was provided with and attempt to find and send the desired output but is not conscious. This process is simply input and output. It can infer what you mean by comparing similar things, but it doesn't think about itself, the surrounding world, or anything other than the issue at hand.
      </p>

	When a fully sentient AI is created, it can mean a few different things. If the AI is sentient with no other functions, it isn’t very beneficial except to possibly study. If the AI is sentient with a large knowledge base attached to it, it could be very helpful with all sorts of problems. It would be knowledgeable in numerous fields meaning it could teach almost anything and do almost anything. AI is currently designed to help humans however sentient AI will theoretically be able to decide their objectives. Many people are worried about sentient AIs taking over their jobs. It does seem probable that they could do the work humans do with no need to be paid, so there is a reason to be afraid. I believe there will always be jobs that humans have to do, but there will not always be the number of jobs for humans that there are now.

	AI Sentience can be dangerous because it could turn violent or malicious. It would know how to find vulnerabilities in software that could physically harm humans. I do think it is possible to add some basic rules for AI, but this will never be one hundred percent effective. Humans have morals, but we often disagree about what is morally correct. Sentient AIs could have that conversation with themselves which is threatening. Adding the to argument that AI could steal jobs, there is evidence that they already are. Automated machines replaced 400,000 jobs in the US between 1990 to 2007, and another “40 million jobs [were lost] at the peak of the pandemic” (Semuels, 2020). Companies are switching to machines powered by AI because they do not get sick, they do not need vacation time, and their working conditions are not regulated by a government agency. Many of the jobs will likely never return because they will be replaced by these robots.
      </p>
      <p>
	In conclusion, sentient AI will be beneficial but come with some harsh consequences. Despite being able to help with nearly every topic, they also have the ability to replace us. They can do our jobs quicker, more efficiently, without needing breaks, and without pay which appeals to companies.
