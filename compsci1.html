	In 2021, I learned a decent bit in Computer Science 1. Before the year started, I hadn't even heard of Swift. By the end of the year, I had learned the basics of Swift & expanded my Linux skills. I knew some about the Linux Operating System before the class, but not a lot. I learned the common commands, how to use emacs, and how the general structure of UNIX & Linux. Taking that class allowed me to put on my resume that I had experience with Linux, which my current employers were looking for. I also learned boolean algebra and how number systems like hexadecimal work.
