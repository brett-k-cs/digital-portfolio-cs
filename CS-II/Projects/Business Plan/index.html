	<h1>ISP Business Plan - SchoolFood</h1>
	<h2>Identity</h2>
	<h3>SchoolFood manages an online system for the school cafeterias to be used by students.</h3>
	<h2>Problem</h2>
	<h3>The lines in the cafeteria often take more than twenty minutes to get food. This time could be spent more efficiently by the studuents in order to advance their social skills, academic skills, etc. These times are caused by a buildup of students, cutting in line, and students' slow ordering.</h3>
	<h2>Solution</h2>
	<h3>Our solution is an online ordering system. It prevents cutting, allows students to talk with their friends or do some last-minute homework while waiting for their food, and speeds up overall speeds because the food staff does not have to wait for students to think of & communicate their order. We employ a way to make sure students have to be in the cafeteria at the time of ordering as well as to stop preordering.</h3>
	<h2>Target Market</h2>
	<h3>The target market for our product is school districts or individual schools that have an issue with too long or slow lunch lines. AllenISD is a great example of this. This issue is happening all over the country, so there are numerous opportunities to expand.</h3>
	<h2>The Competition</h2>
	<h3>The competition would be individual restaurants as some of them have their own ordering system. The reason we would be unique however is that most restaurants inside of schools have a different payment system, and their apps would need to be somehow locked down to students.</h3>
	<h2>Revenue Streams</h2>
	<h3>SchoolFood will sell our system which includes our app, backend, and support to school districts. We can also charge a small percentage per order (much less than schoolpay) to the students. A one percent fee is almost nothing to students, but will thousands ordering per day, our profits would dramatically increase.</h3>
	<h2>Marketing Activities</h2>
	<h3>We would introduce our product at school conventions such as the Texas Association of School Boards / Texas Association of School Administrators Convention. We will have a marketing video that appeals to potential customers.</h3>
	<h2>Expenses</h2>
	<h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Web Hosting</li>
	    <li>Domain Registration</li>
	    <li>Labor - Bug Fixing</li>
	  </ul>
	</h3>
	<h2>Team and Key Roles</h2>
	<h3>There are many roles necessary for this company to succeed. There must be front-end developers, back-end developers, marketing members, etc. Front-End developers are in charge of the user interface - meaning the app mostly. The back-end developers are in charge of the server handling all the requests. It has to have a secure way of payment confirmation, an order queue, a way to connect back to the client (mobile app) to tell the user their food is ready. Marketing is in charge of making our product appealing to potential consumers.</h3>
