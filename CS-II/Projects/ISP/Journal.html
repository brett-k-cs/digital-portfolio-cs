	<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  We didn't encounter many technical challenges this week. I'm continuing development of the MVP mobile app. I am semi-limited on testing due to hardware at school, but I am bypassing this issue by working on it at home. The other issue is not everyone in my group has an Android, so they cannot all have the app. We are solving this by using Android Studio to test, and since there is at least one person with an Android in every class period, we can share phones for testing.
	</p>
	<h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  There has now been work on the research, but it is not complete yet. We are about a month behind on that now. The Sample App / MVP is still mostly on track. The Mock App / design for the pages is done, and the code for actually deploying it to a phone isn't far behind.
	</p>
	<h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  The project manager has started assigning more work, and the other members of my group have done some of it. It is better than the previous weeks, but we are still behind and communication is limited. I've set a meeting for Tuesday at 8pm to go over MVP, so we will see who attends. Edit: Everyone attended and we had a productive meeting. We made the MVP presentation and delegated the other tasks we need to finish.

	<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  I fixed last week's technical challenge (testing the app) by connecting to USB-C on the school provided Mac computer, then connecting my phone to my Linux VM. This allowed me to get the app to a functioning state. I will continue working on adding the pages from the Mock App design.
	</p>
	<h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  We are now very behind on research, but still on time for the Sample App / MVP. We have not talked about any graphical design yet, but the color scheme will be changeable by each administration.
	</p>
	<h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  This week, we have about 60% of research done. One other teammate and I have completed their section of the research, one has started, and one still hasn't started yet. I do worry about how much I will have to do by myself on this project if this trend continues.

	<h2>ISP - <u>SchoolFood</u></h2>
	<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	   I encountered the first technical issue. I was developing the minimum viable prodct (MVP) with Android Studio, but testing either requires a virtual phone or an actual phone. ChromeOS should have an emulator (virtual phone), but it wasn't working. I tried connecting my phone via WiFi, but the school wifi doesn't support that. I then tried debugging via USB-C, but it was taking a long time.
	</p>
	<h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  We are mostly on time despite interpersonal challenges. I have completed the Mock App design, and have started on the creation of an Android App that has all of the pages. It will not be functional, but it will have the navigation working.
	</p>
	<h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  Last week I said there were no interpersonal challenges because my team members said they would work on it during the week, but there has barley been any progress from them. The research that took me around 30 minutes still hasn't been completed fully by any of them. I have tried telling them due dates even though I am not project/product manager, but there still has been minimum progress.

	<h2>ISP - <u>SchoolFood</u></h2>
	<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  Still haven't encountered a technical issue. We decided to make an Android App using Kotlin as it is very easy to test on Android unlike IOS. We will be using Android Studio to convert our Mock App into a navigable app for our Minimum Viable Product. We haven't decided if we need any graphical logos or anything specialized for us yet.
	</p>
	<h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  My team members have been a little more active on the Discord, so we have had more conversations about scheduling. We are still sticking to GANTT chart, so we are in the middle of Research and Mock App design. Mock App design is almost done. We have 4 pages planned out so far. We just need checkout, profile (balance mainly), and order history. The graphics are very simple right now, but that can always be changed later if it needs it.

	<h2>ISP - <u>SchoolFood</u></h2>
	<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  We have still not starting programming yet, so we do not have many technical challenges. We are currently discussing functionality and researching other ordering apps. We want to research other ordering apps in order to see which features are necessary and what customers enjoy. We are also looking at reviews for the app to receive input from consumers directly.
	</p>
	<h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  We have our GANTT chart that has our todo list with dates. So far we are on track, so no scheduling challenges yet. We do have some issues with everyone being able to meet, so again, we are using Discord as much as possible.
	</p>
	<h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  The only interpersonal challenge is communication. The split between CS periods causes a larger divide than I had thought it would. We cannot talk face to face a lot of the times. We are still trying to use Discord, but there isn't much activity from team members on there.

	<h2>ISP - <u>SchoolFood</u></h2>
	<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  Our technical challenges have been minimal this week. Since we are still in the planning phase, we have not had to do anything technical yet. We have discussed the functionality of our system which introduced us to a few possible issues we will face down the road. One our possible issues is that we will have to be accepting payment. We want to use PayPams, but since we do not have access to that, we decided we could just have a starting balance for whoever is testing and could "implement" a paypal deposit system that works.
	</p>
	<h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  This week our main scheduling challenge was finding a time everyone was avaliable to meet. We solved this by doing as much as possible online, so people could just fill in their section when they had time. We also setup a meet time for afterschool Friday. We are still on track with our timeline (next task is a full functionality document being done by 01/14/23).
	</p>
	<h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  The first interpersonal challenge our group had was communication. We are split up between Computer Science II periods, so we cannot talk in class. We setup a way to solve this issue which was Discord. Using this service we are able to contact each other at all times and can manage our discussions in different channels. We all got onto a Discord Server and agreed to call after school on Friday in order to dicuss the full functionality of our project.
	</p>
	<h2>Initial Role(s)</h2>
	<p>
	  My initial role for our ISP is Software Development Engineer. This means I am in charge of applying engineering to the software development process. I will follow a version of the engineering design process to be efficient. I am qualified to be this position because I have been programming since I was very young and have worked with the basic concepts our group wishes to implement for this project.
