	<h1>Business Plan Considerations / Reviews:</h1>
	<h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/austin-dlugosch/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="blank">TV360</a> - Austin Dlugosch</h2>
	<h3>I considered this business proposal because it is an interesting concept. There have been times when I needed to rotate my TV, but it was a pain. However, I am concerned about the competition. There are many large companies that already make TV and monitor mounts, so I do not know if the TV360 company would be successful.</h3>
	<h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/george-winters/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank">Bolt</a> - George Winters, Myoram Langwang, Mason Williams, & Matthew Roman</h2>
	<h3>I considered this business proposal because there is a large target market. There are millions of computer science students around the world, and an app connecting them could be very beneficial. I am a little considered about their revenue stream because with a subscription service, many students do not have the financial backing for a subscription service.</h3>
	<h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/joshua-lee/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank">Classroom Attendance via Facial Recognition</a> - Joshua Lee, Cameron Farley, & Oliver Kankins</h2>
	<h3>I considered this business proposal because the proposal relates to an issue I have experienced. I also like the use of AI since I have experience in this field. Teachers normally spend a few minutes on attendence which would be minimized if this product worked. I am not sure about this because they still have to wait for a majority of the students to walk in before starting work. It seems like a cool addition, but technology is not always reliable. If it was not perfect, teachers might spend more time manually checking the program than they would have manually doing it.</h3>
	<h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/vijay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank">Child Detection in Unattended Cars</a> - Vijay Vemulapalli</h2>
	<h3>I considered this business proposal because the goal behind it is a good cause. I like the concept of AI detection in order to prevent harm to children or animals; however, I see a few possible issues with this. The unit would need a way to contact the owner of the car and then the police. It is possible to call 911 by piggybacking off of others signals, but not the owner. If the company added something to fix this, it would be another expense, per the unit, and would not be a one time purchase for them.</h3>
	<h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/rupak-bhattacharya/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank">Physics Studying App</a> - Rupak Bhattacharya</h2>
	<h3>This idea has a large target market. There are thousands if not millions of physics students; however, I feel like there would also be a large competition for a service like this. There are many successful companies already that provide homework help with the ability to talk to a human tutor. I am not sure how many students would pay for the extra material since high school students often do not spend much money.</h3>
	<h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/benjamin-haines/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank">City Planner</a> - Benjamin Haines</h2>
	<h3>I considered this proposal because there is a lot of room to expand the idea. I feel this proposal could work, and if enough users are present, the company could make money from advertisments. City events could even be expanded to include volunteer opportunities. The main issue I see is that there are other, better-known companies that already provide this functionality though. As mentioned, Google has a feature like this, but it is limited.</h3>
	<h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/caysen-mayo/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"><b>The</b> Unity Game</a> - Caysen Mayo, Kyle Hernandez, Ibrahim Deir, & Eric Steiner</h2>
	<h3>This business proposal captured my attention because it is something that I like to do - play videogames. I like the concept of the product, but I do not think there is enough originality to be profitable. There are similar games on steam already, so it would probably get lost in the sea of ads. Also, if the goal is to combine the popular ideas from certain games, there would be copyright issues with the original game creators.</h3>
	<h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/ryan-hallock/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank">Bus Routing</a> - Ryan Hallock</h2>
	<h3>I like the solution to the problem this business proposal outlines. There are many issues with the current bus system which is why many students opt to drive their own cars. I have been on buses that have had to turn around because a student was late which caused the rest of us to also be late. I believe this is a security risk however because there isn't a sure way to determine if the user accessing the map/route is a student. School creditials are not secure with thousands of students because many probably do not care about cybersecurity and have weak passwords. I do not see the school administration allowing this app due to this reason, so I ultimately decide to reject it.</h3>
	<h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/tejasvi-gutta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank">Symptoms Quiz</a> - Tejasvi Gutta</h2>
	<h3>I like the suggested product's purpose. There are a lot of symptoms that if you look up, it basically tells you that you might be dying. The internet is full of clickbait in order to try to farm visits for ads. A quiz that uses scientifically backed questions and answers could help a lot of people. The only reason I reject this proposal is because while I believe the topic is good for humanity, the medical field does not interest me as much as some others. I have also not looked at WebMD, but if they already specialize in this topic, it could be hard to gain traction.</h3>
	<h2><a href="index.html">SchoolFood</a> - Brett Kaplan, Logan Rohlfs, & Blake Gateley</h2>
	<h3>I choose to accept my group's proposal because I like the concept, there is minimal competition, the components are almost all software-based, and there is room to expand if more people join the project. I normally only get lunch on B days since I have STEAM and then A lunch, but even though I get there before the bell rings, there is always a line. I spend 10-20 minutes in that line which is time I could have spent talking with my friends. I see no reason why friends should have to be split up just to stand in a line that advances slower than a snail. I have also seen similar proposals in the spreadsheet, so I would be open to joining another group or having that group join us.</h3>
