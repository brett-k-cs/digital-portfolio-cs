	AI Sentience is beneficial but could have dire consequences. I think we are far from a completely Sentient AI; however, we are getting close to AIs that know pretty much everything about one topic. An example of this is DALL-E 2. It is the most advanced text-to-image converter available currently. It specializes in making words into pictures. There are also Large Language Models such as BLOOM with over 176 billion parameters meaning they are available in multiple languages and have numerous topics. Nevertheless, they take an entire server room to run. Also, it is AI, but it is not sentient. It cannot think for itself. It can take the arguments it was provided with and attempt to find and send the desired output but is not conscious. This process is simply input and output. It can infer what you mean by comparing similar things, but it doesn't think about itself, the surrounding world, or anything other than the issue at hand.

	When a fully sentient AI is created, it can mean a few different things. If the AI is sentient with no other functions, it isnâ€™t very beneficial except to possibly study. If the AI is sentient with a large knowledge base attached to it, it could be very helpful with all sorts of problems. It would be knowledgeable in numerous fields meaning it could teach almost anything and do almost anything. AI is currently designed to help humans however Sentient AI will theoretically be able to decide their objectives.

	AI Sentience can be dangerous because it could turn violent or malicious. It would know how to find vulnerabilities in software that could physically harm humans. I do think it is possible to add some basic rules for AI, but this will never be one hundred percent effective. Humans have morals, but we often disagree about what is morally correct. Sentient AIs could have that conversation with themselves which is threatening.
