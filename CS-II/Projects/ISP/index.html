	<h1>ISP - SchoolFood [Graded]</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	<h3>Our business, SchoolFood, provides an application for schools in order to allow online ordering for students. It will have every option that each resteraunt has in order to make this experience as smooth as possible. This speeds up the time taken to get your lunch order. The application would also allow students to be productive while they wait for their food since they no longer have to wait in line. This means students could talk or do homework. We will have a backend server, a frontend website, and a mobile application. It will have it's own payment system as well as hooking into PayPams to make ordering easy without charging insane fees (SchoolPay!).</h3>

	<h1>ISP - Arena Scheduler (Front)</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	<h3>The goal is to use the backend to provide students the opportunity to easily plan their schedules for next year. It should have two semesters, the correct periods offered for each class, etc. The goal is to release it on time with an easy to understand UI. It should not be so overloaded with features that makes it complicated.</h3>
