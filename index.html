      <h2 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5vh; width: 100%;">Why Do I have a Portfolio?</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 40px;">
	The simple answer, it is required. However, it also important to have a digital portfolio because it can act as a resume. Employers often want an example of what you can do and what you have done. Many software engineers & front-end developers have amazing digital portfolios that show off their skills. My favorite is <a href="https://bruno-simon.com/" target="_blank">Bruno Simon's portfolio</a>. He uses ThreeJS to make an amazing and interactive portfolio. It shows off his previous projects and his current projects which builds his credibility. This is why a portfolio is important to me. I want to have a place that I can link to that shows off all of my education, my previous projects, my previous employers, and any other experience.
