	Decision biases are detrimental to decision-making. They can cause bad decisions because they cloud our judgment. Some decision biases I believe my Individual Study Project (ISP) group will have are desire biases, habit biases, overconfidence biases, bandwagon biases, and availability biases (Arnott; Gordon, 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
	I believe that the group I am a part of could have desire biases because we have vast goals. If we get so stuck on one particular objective of the project, we might ignore the other pursuits. This is an issue because if the output of that becomes too important, the focus on it could make it seem like it is the only goal that matters (Arnott). My group will employ a strict timeline system to prevent this from happening. We will set end dates; we will make sure when that date is over, we will stop working on it. We can revisit it when the rest of the project is complete, but the work for that part will not be touched again until then.
      </p>
      <p>
	Our group could also have habit biases since we have all worked on computer science projects before. We might believe that the way we did previously is the best way without exploring other options (Arnott). The focus on the original way could lead to problems down the road when one section does not integrate well with the rest of the project. To prevent this from happening, we will involve all group members in decision-making and research the compatibility each system has with the other parts of the design.
      </p>
      <p>
	An overconfidence bias is when someone believes that they can definitely do something. It is common when the member doesnâ€™t know much about the task they are trying to complete (Arnott). My ISP group could have this bias because a few of the objectives we will be attempting to do are things we do not have experience with yet. If a function seems simple but is not, we might not allot enough time to that specific task. To avoid this bias and potential issue, we have a research section at the start of our project where we will research everything we plan to do and revise our timeline accordingly if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
	The bandwagon bias is common in computer science. When programmers have an issue, they normally visit forum posts on websites such as StackOverflow. This can lead to following whatever the first reply or answer has said to do. We believe that since it worked for this person, it will work for us with no problems (Gordom, 2022). The issue with some problems is that they are so unique that the answer will not likely just be on a public forum. Most likely, we will have to delve into the documentation or other official programming resources. Programmers normally shy away from this because the answer could just be online. Our group will take on the policy of preferring official resources over forum posts to circumvent any possible bandwagon bias.
      </p>
      <p>
	Our group could have availability biases which are when people focus on the immediate problem in front of them instead of the planned problem or researching more (Gordon, 2022). This could happen by following a timeline as well since following strict deadlines means we need to move on. Our group can attempt to block this from happening by researching during the allotted time.
