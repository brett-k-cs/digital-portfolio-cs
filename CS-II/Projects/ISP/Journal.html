	<h2>ISP - <u>SchoolFood</u></h2>
	<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  Our technical challenges have been minimal this week. Since we are still in the planning phase, we have not had to do anything technical yet. We have discussed the functionality of our system which introduced us to a few possible issues we will face down the road. One our possible issues is that we will have to be accepting payment. We want to use PayPams, but since we do not have access to that, we decided we could just have a starting balance for whoever is testing and could "implement" a paypal deposit system that works.
	</p>
	<h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  This week our main scheduling challenge was finding a time everyone was avaliable to meet. We solved this by doing as much as possible online, so people could just fill in their section when they had time. We also setup a meet time for afterschool Friday. We are still on track with our timeline (next task is a full functionality document being done by 01/14/23).
	</p>
	<h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
	<p>
	  The first interpersonal challenge our group had was communication. We are split up between Computer Science II periods, so we cannot talk in class. We setup a way to solve this issue which was Discord. Using this service we are able to contact each other at all times and can manage our discussions in different channels. We all got onto a Discord Server and agreed to call after school on Friday in order to dicuss the full functionality of our project.

	<h2>Initial Role(s)</h2>
	<p>
	  My initial role for our ISP is Software Development Engineer. This means I am in charge of applying engineering to the software development process. I will follow a version of the engineering design process to be efficient. I am qualified to be this position because I have been programming since I was very young and have worked with the basic concepts our group wishes to implement for this project.
